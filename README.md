### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

:thought_balloon: My name is Anthony and im 28

:mortar_board: I am currently learning JavaScript with O'Clock School. After browsing Node.JS and its dependencies, I learn how to use React.js.

:computer: Throughout the training I realized some projects. You can have an overview on my Git Hub, or with the link of my portfolio on my profile.

Here are some fast links : 
- :rainbow:[Axoll Draw Project](http://www.salleanthony.fr:6525/)
- :paw_prints:[AHN Project](http://www.salleanthony.fr:6523/)

I am also learning to manage an Virtual Dedicated Server :floppy_disk: in a self-taught way to accommodate my projects.

Feel free to ask me your questions and discuss with me on any subject. ðŸ’¬
